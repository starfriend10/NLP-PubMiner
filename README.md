# NLP-PubMiner
Utilize NLP text mining methods to identify relevant research articles for data mining based on large database.
> [!NOTE]
> * <b>Phase I.</b> Publication data_Pretreatment: Preprocessing publication record data based on title, abstract, and author keywords
> * <b>Phase II.</b> Publication data_Identification: Applying topic keywords and anti-keywords to identify relevant publications

The agorithm shared in this repository is a updated, simplified version mainly designed to retrieve and organize data based on publication records from the Web of Science. The method was initially developed in 2020 as part of the text mining aglorithem was designed for Zhu et al. (2021) and citation can be made for:
